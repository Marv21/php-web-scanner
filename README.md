## PHP massive web scanner

This scanner will scan a range of IPs given in the form of CIDR.
Please use the network address with 0s, with the mask after the /, or the script will not work properly.
Besides, some anti-script kiddie protections have been implemented, to avoid abuse by them.
So if you use this script, you must at least know what it does, how it does and be yourself capable of writing one.
Have fun :)
